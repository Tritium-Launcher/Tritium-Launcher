# Tritium Launcher
### A Minecraft Launcher IDE for Modpack Developers

This is a work-in-progress Launcher with features specially designed for Modpack Developers, such as:
* A useable Code Editor
* Modpack version uploads to sites such as Curseforge or Modrinth
* Easy Mod config file modification and management
* Console for viewing or uploading Logs, along with proper text theming
* Git integration
* Mod integrations, such as KubeJS or Crafttweaker
* Extensions support (Themes, UI functionality, Mod integration, etc)
* Eventually, more.

In its current form, Tritium is able to:
* Generate ModPack projects along with Licesne files and Git repos
* Download and run Minecraft, Fabric and NeoForge
* Support Extended content
* Support custom Editor panes for specific file types or menus
* Use LSPs for specific file types

There is much more planned, check out the [TODO Project](https://github.com/orgs/Tritium-Launcher/projects/1) to see current progress.
